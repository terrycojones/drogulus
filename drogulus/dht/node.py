    Encapsulates a lookup in the DHT given a particular target key and message

    defined, will timeout with an errback.

    From the original Kademlia paper:

    "The most important procedure a Kademlia participant must perform is to
    locate the k closest nodes to some given node ID. We call this procedure a
    node lookup. Kademlia employs a recursive algorithm for node lookups. The
    lookup initiator starts by picking α nodes from its closest non-empty
    k-bucket (or, if that bucket has fewer than α entries, it just takes the α
    closest nodes it knows of). The initiator then sends parallel, asynchronous
    FIND NODE RPCs to the α nodes it has chosen. α is a system-wide concurrency
    parameter, such as 3.

    In the recursive step, the initiator resends the FIND NODE to nodes it has
    learned about from previous RPCs. (This recursion can begin before all α of
    the previous RPCs have returned). Of the k nodes the initiator has heard of
    closest to the target, it picks α that it has not yet queried and resends
    the FIND NODE RPC to them. Nodes that fail to respond quickly are removed
    from consideration until and unless they do respond. If a round of FIND
    NODEs fails to return a node any closer than the closest already seen, the
    initiator resends the FIND NODE to all of the k closest nodes it has not
    already queried. The lookup terminates when the initiator has queried and
    gotten responses from the k closest nodes it has seen. When α = 1 the
    lookup algorithm resembles Chord’s in terms of message cost and the latency
    of detecting failed nodes. However, Kademlia can route for lower latency
    because it has the flexibility of choosing any one of k nodes to forward a
    request to."

    READ THIS CAREFULLY! Here's how this implementation works:

    self.target - the target key for the lookup.
    self.message_type - the message class (either FindNode or FindValue).
    self.local_node - the local node that created the NodeLookup.
    self.shortlist - an ordered list containing nodes close to the target.
    self.contacted - a set of nodes that have been contacted for this lookup.
    self.nearest_node - the node nearest to the target so far.
    self.pending_requests - a dictionary of currently pending requests.
    constants.ALPHA - the number of concurrent asynchronous calls allowed.
    constants.K - the number of closest nodes to return when complete.
    constants.LOOKUP_TIMEOUT - the default maximum duration for a lookup.

    0. If "timeout" number of seconds elapse before the lookup is finished then
       cancel any pending requests and errback with an OutOfTime error. The
       "timeout" value can be overridden but defaults to
       constants.LOOKUP_TIMEOUT seconds.

    1. Locally known nodes from the routing table seed self.shortlist.

    2. The nearest node to the target in self.shortlist is set as
       self.nearest_node.

    3. No more than constants.ALPHA nearest nodes that are in self.shortlist
       but not in self.contacted are sent a message that is an instance of
       self.message_type. Each request is added to the self.pending_requests
       list. The length of self.pending_requests must never be more than
       constants.ALPHA.

    4. As each node is contacted it is added to the self.contacted set.

    5. If a node doesn't reply or an error is encountered it is removed from
       self.shortlist and self.pending_requests. Start from step 3 again.

    6. When a response to a request is returned successfully remove the request
       from self.pending_requests.

    7. If it's a FindValue message and a suitable value is returned (see note
       at the end of these comments) cancel all the other pending calls in
       self.pending_requests and fire a callback with with the returned value.
       If the value is invalid remove the node from self.shortlist and start
       from step 3 again without cancelling the other pending calls.

    8. If a list of closer nodes is returned by a peer add them to
       self.shortlist and sort - making sure nodes in self.contacted are not
       mistakenly re-added to the shortlist.

    7. If the nearest node in the newly sorted self.shortlist is closer to the
       target than self.nearest_node then set self.nearest_node to the new
       closer node and start from step 3 again.

    8. If self.nearest_node remains unchanged DO NOT start a new call.

    9. If there are no other requests in self.pending_requests then check that
       the constants.K nearest nodes in the self.contacted set are all closer
       than the nearest node in self.shortlist. If they are, and it's a
       FindNode message call back with the constants.K nearest nodes in the
       self.contacted set. If the message is a FindValue, errback with a
       ValueNotFound error.

    10. If there are still nearer nodes in self.shortlist to some of those in
        the constants.K nearest nodes in the self.contacted set then start
        from step 3 again (forcing the local node to contact the close nodes
        that have yet to be contacted).

    Note on validating values: In the future there may be constraints added to
    the FindValue query (such as only accepting values created after time T).
